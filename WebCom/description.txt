WebCom (formerly known as Webmilio's Commons Library) adds a couple of things I use in all of my mods. You can extract the DLL from the Mod. 
Sample mod: https://github.com/webmilio/Terraria.WebmilioCommons.ExampleMod

Update 1.0 breaks everything except ScreenShake. All namespaces have switched from WebmilioCommons. to WebCom.

Features:
- Better Networking (in my opinion, at least)
- Attribute-based Loading/Saving
- A bunch of extensions
- [WIP] Proxies for internal tMod classes
- Effects: screenshake (multiplayer compatible)
- Math/Vector stuffs: velocity vector to point/mouse, checking if a point is inside a triangle/rectangle (since you can't with normal rectangles)
- Dependency Injection container: SimpleServices class coupled with [Service] attribute allows for simple class decoupling.
